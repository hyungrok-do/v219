abstract: We present RadGraph2, a novel dataset for extracting information from radiology
  reports that focuses on capturing changes in disease state and device placement
  over time. We introduce a hierarchical schema that organizes entities based on their
  relationships and show that using this hierarchy during training improves the performance
  of an information extraction model. Specifically, we propose a modification to the
  DyGIE++ framework, resulting in our model HGIE, which outperforms previous models
  in entity and relation extraction tasks. We demonstrate that RadGraph2 enables models
  to capture a wider variety of findings and perform better at relation extraction
  compared to those trained on the original RadGraph dataset. Our work provides the
  foundation for developing automated systems that can track disease progression over
  time and develop information extraction models that leverage the natural hierarchy
  of labels in the medical domain.
