abstract: Univariate high-frequency time series are dominant data sources for many
  medical, economic and environmental applications. In many of these domains, the
  time series are tied to real-time changes in state. In the intensive care unit,
  for example, changes and intracranial pressure waveforms can indicate whether a
  patient is developing decreased blood perfusion to the brain during a stroke, for
  example. However, most representation learning to resolve states is conducted in
  an offline, batch-dependent manner. In high frequency time-series, high intra-state
  and inter-sample variability makes offline, batch-dependent learning a relatively
  difficult task. Hence, we propose Spatial Resolved Temporal Networks (SpaRTeN),
  a novel composite deep learning model for online, unsupervised representation learning
  through a spatially constrained latent space. SpaRTeN maps waveforms to states,
  and learns time-dependent representations of each state. Our key contribution is
  that we generate clinically relevant representations of each state for intracranial
  pressure waveforms.
