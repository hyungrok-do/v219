abstract: Heart failure is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people
  worldwide and has a significant impact on their quality of life and mortality rates.
  An objective assessment of cardiac pressures remains an important method for the
  diagnosis and treatment prognostication for patients with heart failure. Although
  cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for estimating central hemodynamic
  pressures, it is an invasive procedure that carries inherent risks, making it a
  potentially dangerous procedure for some patients. Approaches that leverage non-invasive
  signals – such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) – have the promise to make the routine
  estimation of cardiac pressures feasible in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
  Prior models trained to estimate intracardiac pressures (e.g., mean pulmonary capillary
  wedge pressure (mPCWP)) in a supervised fashion have shown good discriminatory ability
  but have been limited to the labeled dataset from the heart failure cohort. Furthermore,
  obtaining large datasets for diverse patient cohorts with intracardiac pressure
  labels is challenging due to the invasive nature of the procedure. To address these
  issues and build a robust representation, we apply traditional deep metric learning
  (DML) and propose a novel self-supervised DML with distance-based mining that improves
  the performance of a model with limited labels. We use a dataset that contains over
  5.4 million ECGs without concomitant central pressure labels to pre-train a self-supervised
  DML model which showed improved classification of elevated mPCWP compared to self-supervised
  contrastive baselines. Additionally, the supervised DML model that uses ECGs with
  access to 8,172 mPCWP labels demonstrated significantly better performance on the
  mPCWP regression task compared to the supervised baseline. Moreover, our data suggest
  that DML yields models that are performant across patient subgroups, even when some
  patient subgroups are under-represented in the dataset.
