abstract: Deep neural networks in computer vision have shown remarkable progress in
  recognizing facial genetic syndromes. Many genetic syndromes are difficult to detect,
  even for experienced clinicians, and computer-aided phenotyping can accelerate clinical
  diagnosis. High-stakes clinical tasks using deep learning, as in clinical genetics,
  require human understandable explanations for model decisions. Saliency methods
  are used to explain DNN predictions in various image analysis domains but have yet
  to be studied in facial genetics. The syndromic features of most genetic conditions
  are often localized to areas like the eyes, nose, and mouth. In this paper, to summarize
  the contribution of key facial regions to a specific disease prediction, we propose
  a face region relevance score that can be applied to any saliency method. We also
  investigate how prior knowledge, namely human phenotype ontology and DNN model explanations,
  align. Quantitative experiments are performed on a new database containing over
  3,500 images of 11 rare facial syndromes, a healthy control group, and an additional
  test set of 171 facial images, whose respective facial phenotypes are labeled by
  clinicians. Current saliency methods are good at capturing dysmorphism in particular
  regions (parts of the face), but they may not completely capture all the relevant
  features in a given person or condition. Our study indicates which saliency explanations
  and face regions are more consistent with the phenotypes of specific genetic syndromes
  and could be used in large-scale clinical evaluations.
