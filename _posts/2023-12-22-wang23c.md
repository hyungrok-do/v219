abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various domains,
  including healthcare. However, the specialized nature of clinical language understanding
  tasks presents unique challenges and limitations that warrant further investigation.
  In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, namely
  GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard, within the realm of clinical language understanding tasks.
  These tasks span a diverse range, including named entity recognition, relation extraction,
  natural language inference, semantic textual similarity, document classification,
  and question-answering. We also introduce a novel prompting strategy, self-questioning
  prompting (SQP), tailored to enhance the performance of LLMs by eliciting informative
  questions and answers pertinent to the clinical scenarios at hand. Our evaluation
  highlights the importance of employing task-specific learning strategies and prompting
  techniques, such as SQP, to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs in healthcare-related
  tasks. Our study emphasizes the need for cautious implementation of LLMs in healthcare
  settings, ensuring a collaborative approach with domain experts and continuous verification
  by human experts to achieve responsible and effective use, ultimately contributing
  to improved patient care. Our code is available at https://github.com/EternityYW/LLM_healthcare.
