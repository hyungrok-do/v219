abstract: Time series data are found in many areas of healthcare such as medical time
  series, electronic health records (EHR), measurements of vitals, and wearable devices.
  Causal discovery, which involves estimating causal relationships from observational
  data, holds the potential to play a significant role in extracting actionable insights
  about human health. In this study, we present a novel constraint-based causal discovery
  approach for autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data (CDANs). Our proposed
  method addresses several limitations of existing causal discovery methods for autocorrelated
  and non-stationary time series data, such as high dimensionality, the inability
  to identify lagged causal relationships and overlooking changing modules. Our approach
  identifies lagged and instantaneous/contemporaneous causal relationships along with
  changing modules that vary over time. The method optimizes the conditioning sets
  in a constraint-based search by considering lagged parents instead of conditioning
  on the entire past that addresses high dimensionality. The changing modules are
  detected by considering both contemporaneous and lagged parents. The approach first
  detects the lagged adjacencies, then identifies the changing modules and contemporaneous
  adjacencies, and finally determines the causal direction. We extensively evaluated
  our proposed method on synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and compared
  its performance with several baseline approaches. The experimental results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting causal relationships and changing
  modules for autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data.
