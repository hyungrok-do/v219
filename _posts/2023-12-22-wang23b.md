abstract: Self-supervised representation learning on image-text data facilitates crucial
  medical applications, such as image classification, visual grounding, and cross-modal
  retrieval. One common approach involves contrasting semantically similar (positive)
  and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data points. Drawing negative samples uniformly
  from the training data set introduces false negatives, i.e., samples that are treated
  as dissimilar but belong to the same class. In healthcare data, the underlying class
  distribution is nonuniform, implying that false negatives occur at a highly variable
  rate. To improve the quality of learned representations, we develop a novel approach
  that corrects for false negatives. Our method can be viewed as a variant of debiased
  contrastive learning that uses estimated sample-specific class probabilities. We
  provide theoretical analysis of the objective function and demonstrate the proposed
  approach on both image and paired image-text data sets. Our experiments illustrate
  empirical advantages of sample-specific debiasing.
