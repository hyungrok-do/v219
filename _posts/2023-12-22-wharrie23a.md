abstract: Family history is considered a risk factor for many diseases because it
  implicitly captures shared genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Finland’s
  nationwide electronic health record (EHR) system spanning multiple generations presents
  new opportunities for studying a connected network of medical histories for entire
  families. In this work we present a graph-based deep learning approach for learning
  explainable, supervised representations of how each family member’s longitudinal
  medical history influences a patient’s disease risk. We demonstrate that this approach
  is beneficial for predicting 10-year disease onset for 5 complex disease phenotypes,
  compared to clinically-inspired and deep learning baselines for Finland’s nationwide
  EHR system comprising 7 million individuals with up to third-degree relatives. Through
  the use of graph explainability techniques, we illustrate that a graph-based approach
  enables more personalized modeling of family information and disease risk by identifying
  important relatives and features for prediction.
