abstract: 'Electronic health records (EHRs) recorded in hospital settings typically
  contain a wide range of numeric time series data that is characterized by high sparsity
  and irregular observations. Effective modelling for such data must exploit its time
  series nature, the semantic relationship between different types of observations,
  and information in the sparsity structure of the data. Self-supervised Transformers
  have shown outstanding performance in a variety of structured tasks in NLP and computer
  vision. But multivariate time series data contains structured relationships over
  two dimensions: time and recorded event type, and straightforward applications of
  Transformers to time series data do not leverage this distinct structure. The quadratic
  scaling of self-attention layers can also significantly limit the input sequence
  length without appropriate input engineering. We introduce the DuETT architecture,
  an extension of Transformers designed to attend over both time and event type dimensions,
  yielding robust representations from EHR data. DuETT uses an aggregated input where
  sparse time series are transformed into a regular sequence with fixed length; this
  lowers the computational complexity relative to previous EHR Transformer models
  and, more importantly, enables the use of larger and deeper neural networks. When
  trained with self-supervised prediction tasks, that provide rich and informative
  signals for model pre-training, our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning
  models on multiple downstream tasks from the MIMIC-IV and PhysioNet-2012 EHR datasets.'
