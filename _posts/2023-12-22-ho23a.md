abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
  with a high incidence of recurrence following surgical resection. Accurate prognostication
  of recurrence risk is essential to identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant
  therapies and improve their health outcomes. In our study, we propose a novel approach
  to CRC recurrence prognostication using multi-view deep learning. Our proposed approach,
  Fusion with Multi-view Attention (FMA), integrates static and longitudinal data
  from heterogeneous healthcare records, and learns complex interactions between data
  views to predict recurrence and time-to-recurrence. Our model achieves an AUROC
  score of 0.97, and precision, sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.80, 0.90 and
  0.95 respectively, outperforming all-known published results based on the commonly-used
  CEA prognostic marker, as well as state-of-the-art CRC recurrence prognostication
  models. We show through a sensitivity analysis that incorporating multiple data
  views improves model performance significantly compared to using only a single view.
  We also show that our model accurately stratifies patients into risk groups that
  are associated with the actual 5-year recurrence-free survival, paving the way towards
  better identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapies.
  Our proposed approach demonstrates the potential of multi-view modelling to push
  state-of-the-art in CRC recurrence prognostication and could contribute towards
  more personalised patient management and follow-up in the clinic.
