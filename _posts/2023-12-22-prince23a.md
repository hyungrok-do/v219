abstract: 'We introduce the Explainable Analytical Systems Lab (EASL) framework, an
  end-to-end solution designed to facilitate the development, implementation, and
  evaluation of clinical machine learning (ML) tools. EASL is highly versatile and
  applicable to a variety of contexts and includes resources for data management,
  ML model development, visualization and user interface development, service hosting,
  and usage analytics. To demonstrate its practical applications, we present the EASL
  framework in the context of a case study: designing and evaluating a deep learning
  classifier to predict diagnoses from medical imaging. The framework is composed
  of three modules, each with their own set of resources. The Workbench module stores
  data and develops initial ML models, the Canvas module contains a medical imaging
  viewer and web development framework, and the Studio module hosts the ML model and
  provides web analytics and support for conducting user studies. EASL encourages
  model developers to take a holistic view by integrating the model development, implementation,
  and evaluation into one framework, and thus ensures that models are both effective
  and reliable when used in a clinical setting. EASL contributes to our understanding
  of machine learning applied to healthcare by providing a comprehensive framework
  that makes it easier to develop and evaluate ML tools within a clinical setting.'
