abstract: Survival analysis is a general framework for predicting the time until a
  specific event occurs, often in the presence of censoring. Although this framework
  is widely used in practice, few studies to date have considered fairness for time-to-event
  outcomes, despite recent significant advances in the algorithmic fairness literature
  more broadly. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve demographic parity
  in survival analysis models by minimizing the mutual information between predicted
  time-to-event and sensitive attributes. We show that our approach effectively minimizes
  mutual information to encourage statistical independence of time-to-event predictions
  and sensitive attributes. Furthermore, we propose four types of disparity assessment
  metrics based on common survival analysis metrics. Through experiments on multiple
  benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that by minimizing the dependence between the
  prediction and the sensitive attributes, our method can systematically improve the
  fairness of survival predictions and is robust to censoring.
