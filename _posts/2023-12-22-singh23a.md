abstract: In healthcare and biomedical applications, extreme computational requirements
  pose a significant barrier to adopting representation learning. Representation learning
  can enhance the performance of deep learning architectures by learning useful priors
  from limited medical data. However, state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques
  suffer from reduced performance when using smaller batch sizes or shorter pretraining
  epochs, which are more practical in clinical settings. We present Cross Architectural
  - Self Supervision (CASS) in response to this challenge. This novel siamese self-supervised
  learning approach synergistically leverages Transformer and Convolutional Neural
  Networks (CNN) for efficient learning. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that
  CASS-trained CNNs and Transformers outperform existing self-supervised learning
  methods across four diverse healthcare datasets. With only 1% labeled data for finetuning,
  CASS achieves a 3.8% average improvement; with 10% labeled data, it gains 5.9%;
  and with 100% labeled data, it reaches a remarkable 10.13% enhancement. Notably,
  CASS reduces pretraining time by 69% compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
  it more amenable to clinical implementation. We also demonstrate that CASS is considerably
  more robust to variations in batch size and pretraining epochs, making it a suitable
  candidate for machine learning in healthcare applications.
