abstract: Reliable extraction of temporal relations from clinical notes is a growing
  need in many clinical research domains. Our work introduces typed markers to the
  task of clinical temporal relation extraction. We demonstrate that the addition
  of medical entity information to clinical text as tags with context sentences then
  input to a transformer-based architecture can outperform more complex systems requiring
  feature engineering and temporal reasoning. We propose several strategies of typed
  marker creation that incorporate entity type information at different granularities,
  with extensive experiments to test their effectiveness. Our system establishes the
  best result on I2B2, a clinical benchmark dataset for temporal relation extraction,
  with a F1 at 83.5% that provides a substantial 3.3% improvement over the previous
  best system.
