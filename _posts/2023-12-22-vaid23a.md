abstract: Artificial intelligence has impacted many aspects of modern medical care
  but depends critically on data. Videos of medical procedures are a valuable resource
  for computer vision algorithms but labeling them can be costly and requires expert
  knowledge. This paper explores how to leverage low-quality, unlabeled videos scraped
  from the internet in addition to a limited amount of labeled images to improve object
  detection during surgical procedures. We establish the first benchmark for semi-supervised
  hand detection during open surgery and show that existing benchmarks in non-medical
  contexts are not indicative of performance differences on real-world medical applications,
  where data is noisy and poorly labeled. We propose a end-to-end trainable two-stage
  object detector that employs consistency loss to learn from unlabeled images. The
  model is robust to missing labels, variance in hand morphology, and extreme domain
  shifts such as those encountered in open-source videos of surgeries scraped from
  YouTube. Our method can predict surgeonsâ€™ hands in surgical videos even when only
  a fraction of hands are labeled in each frame of the labeled set. Adding unlabeled
  data, we can detect hands more accurately than existing end-to-end semi-supervised
  object detection algorithms.
