abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) provides abundant information through various
  modalities. However, learning multi-modal EHR is currently facing two major challenges,
  namely, 1) irregular and asynchronous sampling and 2) modality missing. Moreover,
  a lack of shared embedding function across modalities can discard the temporal relationship
  between different EHR modalities. On the other hand, most EHR studies are limited
  to relying only on EHR Times-series, and therefore, missing modality in EHR has
  not been well-explored. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a Unified Multi-modal
  Set Embedding (UMSE) and Modality-Aware Attention (MAA) with Skip Bottleneck (SB).
  UMSE treats all EHR modalities without a separate imputation module or error-prone
  carry-forward, whereas MAA with SB learns missing modal EHR with effective modality-aware
  attention. Our model outperforms other baseline models in mortality, vasopressor
  need, and intubation need prediction with the MIMIC-IV dataset.
