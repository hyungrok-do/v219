abstract: Cervical cancer is a life-threatening disease and one of the most prevalent
  types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Being able to adequately identify and
  assess factors that elevate risk of cervical cancer is crucial for early detection
  and treatment. Advances in machine learning have produced new methods for predicting
  cervical cancer risk, however their complex black-box behaviour remains a key barrier
  to their adoption in clinical practice. Recently, there has been substantial rise
  in the development of local explainability techniques aimed at breaking down a model’s
  predictions for particular instances in terms of, for example, meaningful concepts,
  important features, decision tree or rule-based logic, among others. While these
  techniques can help users better understand key factors driving a model’s decisions
  in some situations, they may not always be consistent or provide faithful predictions,
  particularly in applications with heterogeneous outcomes. In this paper, we present
  a critical analysis of several existing local interpretability methods for explaining
  risk factors associated with cervical cancer. Our goal is to help clinicians who
  use AI to better understand which types of explanations to use in particular contexts.
  We present a framework for studying the quality of different explanations for cervical
  cancer risk and contextualise how different explanations might be appropriate for
  different patient scenarios through an empirical analysis. Finally, we provide practical
  advice for practitioners as to how to use different types of explanations for assessing
  and determining key factors driving cervical cancer risk.
