abstract: Applying deep learning to medical imaging tasks is not straightforward due
  to the variable quality and relatively low volume of healthcare data. There is often
  considerable risk that deep learning models may use contextual cues instead of physiologically
  relevant features to achieve the clinical task. Although these cues can provide
  shortcuts to high performance within a carefully crafted training set, they often
  lead to poor performance in real-world applications. Contrastive self-supervision
  (CSS) has recently been shown to boost performance of deep learning on downstream
  applications in several medical imaging tasks. However, it is unclear how much of
  these pre-trained representations are impacted by contextual cues, both known and
  unknown. In this work, we evaluate how CSS pre-training can produce not only more
  accurate but also more trustworthy and generalizable models for clinical imaging
  applications. Specifically, we evaluate the saliency and accuracy of deep learning
  models using CSS in contrast to end-to-end supervised training and conventional
  transfer learning from natural image datasets using an institutional specific and
  public cardiomyopathy cohorts. We find that CSS pre-training models not only improve
  downstream diagnostic performance in each cohort, but more importantly, also produced
  models with higher saliency in cardiac anatomy. Our code is available at https://github.com/makiya11/ssl_spur_cmr.
