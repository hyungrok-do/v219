abstract: We propose Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as an approach for automated
  radiology report writing, using multimodally-aligned embeddings from a contrastively-pretrained
  vision language model to retrieve relevant radiology text for a given image, and
  then using a general domain generative model, such as OpenAI text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo
  and gpt-4, to generate a report based on the retrieved text. This approach keeps
  hallucinated generations under check and provides capabilities to generate report
  content in the format we desire, leveraging the instruction following capabilities
  of generative models. Our approach achieves better clinical metrics with a BERTScore
  of 0.2865 ($\Delta$+ 25.88 %) and Semb score of 0.4026 ($\Delta$+ 6.31 %). Our approach
  can be useful for different clinical settings, as it can augment the automated radiology
  report generation process with relevant content. It also allows to inject the user
  intents and requirements in the prompts, which can modulate the content and format
  of the generated reports according to the clinical setting.
