abstract: 'Long-form clinical summarization of hospital admissions has real-world
  significance because of its potential to help both clinicians and patients. The
  factual consistency of summaries– their faithfulness–is critical to their safe usage
  in clinical settings. To better understand the limitations of state-of-the-art natural
  language processing (NLP) systems, as well as the suitability of existing evaluation
  metrics, we benchmark faithfulness metrics against fine-grained human annotations
  for model-generated summaries of a patient’s Brief Hospi tal Course. We create a
  corpus of patient hospital admissions and summaries for a cohort of HIV patients,
  each with complex medical histories. Annotators are presented with summaries and
  source notes, and asked to categorize manually highlighted summary elements (clinical
  entities like conditions and medications as well as actions like ”following up”)
  into one of three categories: “Incorrect,” “Missing,” and “Not in Notes.” We meta-evaluate
  a broad set of faithfulness metrics–proposed for the general NLP domain–by measuring
  the correlation of metric scores to clinician ratings. Across metrics, we explore
  the importance of domain adaptation (e.g. the impact of in-domain pre-training and
  metric fine-tuning), the use of source-summary alignments, and the effects of distilling
  a single metric from an ensemble. We find that off-the-shelf metrics with no exposure
  to clinical text correlate well to clinician ratings yet overly rely on copy-and-pasted
  text. As a practical guide, we observe that most metrics correlate best to clinicians
  when provided with one summary sentence at a time and a minimal set of supporting
  sentences from the notes before discharge.'
