abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a degenerative valve condition that causes substantial
  morbidity and mortality. This condition is under-diagnosed and under-treated. In
  clinical practice, AS is diagnosed with expert review of transthoracic echocardiography,
  which produces dozens of ultrasound images of the heart. Only some of these views
  show the aortic valve. To automate screening for AS, deep networks must learn to
  mimic a human expertâ€™s ability to identify views of the aortic valve then aggregate
  across these relevant images to produce a study-level diagnosis. We find previous
  approaches to AS detection yield insufficient accuracy due to relying on inflexible
  averages across images. We further find that off-the-shelf attention-based multiple
  instance learning (MIL) performs poorly. We contribute a new end-to-end MIL approach
  with two key methodological innovations. First, a supervised attention technique
  guides the learned attention mechanism to favor relevant views. Second, a novel
  self-supervised pretraining strategy applies contrastive learning on the representation
  of the whole study instead of individual images as commonly done in prior literature.
  Experiments on an open-access dataset and a temporally-external heldout set show
  that our approach yields higher accuracy while reducing model size.
