abstract: Thrombotic complications are a leading cause of death worldwide, often triggered
  by inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and COVID-19, due to a close relationship
  between inflammation and hemostasis known as immunothrombosis. Platelet activation
  and leukocyte-platelet aggregation play key roles in microthrombotic events, yet
  there are no routine diagnostic predictive biomarkers based on these factors. This
  work presents a novel processing pipeline using label-free Quantitative Phase Imaging
  (QPI) for the detection and quantitative analysis of blood cell aggregates without
  sample preparation. For evaluation, we use different test scenarios and measure
  performance at different stages of the pipeline to gain a better understanding of
  the critical points. We show that, among other classical and machine learning techniques,
  the Mask R-CNN approach achieves the best results for detection, segmentation, and
  classification of cell aggregates. The method successfully identifies aggregate
  levels in whole blood samples and shows elevated levels in >90% of patients with
  COVID-19 or sepsis compared to healthy reference samples, indicating the potential
  of platelet and leukocyte-platelet aggregates as biomarkers for thrombotic diseases.
