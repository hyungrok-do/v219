abstract: Manual segmentation of brain metastases (BM) is a laborious and time-consuming
  task for expert clinicians, especially in the setting of longitudinal patient imaging.
  Although automated deep learning (DL) approaches can segment larger lesions effectively,
  they suffer from poor sensitivity of lesion detection for micro-metastases. Moreover,
  these approaches segment all patient imaging independently of each other, ignoring
  relevant information from prior time-points. In order to utilize prior time-point
  information, we propose SPIRS, a joint image registration and segmentation method.
  Given a prior time-point image and segmentation mask (which are readily available
  in a routine clinical environment), we affinely and deformably register these to
  a new time-point image. This warped prior image and mask are then used to enhance
  and improve the segmentation of the new time-point. We apply SPIRS to a large retrospectively
  acquired single institution dataset and show that it outperforms current registration
  approaches on BM imaging and that it significantly improves segmentation performance
  for micro-metastatic lesions.
