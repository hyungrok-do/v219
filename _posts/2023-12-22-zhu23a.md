abstract: AI-driven medical history-taking is an important component in symptom checking,
  automated patient intake, triage, and other AI virtual care applications. As history-taking
  is extremely varied, machine learning models require a significant amount of data
  to train. To overcome this challenge, existing systems are developed using indirect
  data or expert knowledge. This leads to a training-inference gap as models are trained
  on different kinds of data than what they observe at inference time. In this work,
  we present a two-stage re-ranking approach that helps close the training-inference
  gap by re-ranking the first-stage question candidates using a dialogue-contextualized
  model. For this, we propose a new model, global re-ranker, which cross-encodes the
  dialogue with all questions simultaneously, and compare it with several existing
  neural baselines. We test both transformer and S4-based language model backbones.
  We find that relative to the expert system, the best performance is achieved by
  our proposed global re-ranker with a transformer backbone, resulting in a 30% higher
  normalized discount cumulative gain (nDCG) and a 77% higher mean average precision
  (mAP). As part of this work, we also release pre-trained checkpoints for bi-directional
  and autoregressive S4 models trained on Wikipedia and PubMed data.
