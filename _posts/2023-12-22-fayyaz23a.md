abstract: Sleep apnea in children is a major health problem affecting one to five
  percent of children (in the US). If not treated in a timely manner, it can also
  lead to other physical and mental health issues. Pediatric sleep apnea has different
  clinical causes and characteristics than adults. Despite a large group of studies
  dedicated to studying adult apnea, pediatric sleep apnea has been studied in a much
  less limited fashion. Relatedly, at-home sleep apnea testing tools and algorithmic
  methods for automatic detection of sleep apnea are widely present for adults, but
  not children. In this study, we target this gap by presenting a machine learning-based
  model for detecting apnea events from commonly collected sleep signals. We show
  that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across two public datasets,
  as determined by the F1-score and AUROC measures. Additionally, we show that using
  two of the signals that are easier to collect at home (ECG and SpO2) can also achieve
  very competitive results, potentially addressing the concerns about collecting various
  sleep signals from children outside the clinic. Therefore, our study can greatly
  inform ongoing progress toward increasing the accessibility of pediatric sleep apnea
  testing and improving the timeliness of the treatment interventions.
