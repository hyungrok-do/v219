abstract: 'Results from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) establish the comparative
  effectiveness of interventions, and are in turn critical inputs for evidence-based
  care. However, results from RCTs are presented in (often unstructured) natural language
  articles describing the design, execution, and outcomes of trials; clinicians must
  manually extract findings pertaining to interventions and outcomes of interest from
  such articles. This onerous manual process has motivated work on (semi-)automating
  extraction of structured evidence from trial reports. In this work we propose and
  evaluate a text-to-text model built on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
  to jointly extract Interventions, Outcomes, and Comparators (ICO elements) from
  clinical abstracts, and infer the associated results reported. Manual (expert) and
  automated evaluations indicate that framing evidence extraction as a conditional
  generation task and fine-tuning LLMs for this purpose realizes considerable (âˆ¼20
  point absolute F1 score) gains over the previous SOTA. We perform ablations and
  error analyses to assess aspects that contribute to model performance, and to highlight
  potential directions for further improvements. We apply our model to a collection
  of published RCTs through mid-2022, and release a searchable database of structured
  findings: http://ico-relations.ebm-nlp.com.'
