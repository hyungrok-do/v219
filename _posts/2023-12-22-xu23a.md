abstract: Individuals such as medical interns who work in high-stress environments
  often face mental health challenges including depression and anxiety. These challenges
  are exacerbated by the limited access to traditional mental health services due
  to demanding work schedules. In this context, mobile health interventions such as
  push notifications targeting behavioral modification to improve mental health outcomes
  could deliver much needed support. In this work, we study the effectiveness of these
  interventions on subgroups, by studying the conditional average causal effect of
  these interventions. We design a two step approach for estimating the conditional
  average causal effect of interventions and identifying specific subgroups of the
  population who respond positively or negatively to the interventions. The first
  step of our approach follows existing causal effect estimation approaches, while
  the second step involves a novel tree-based approach to identify subgroups who respond
  to the treatment. The novelty in the second step stems from a pruning approach that
  deploys hypothesis testing to identify subgroups experiencing a statistically significant
  positive or negative causal effect. Using a semi-simulated dataset, we show that
  our approach retrieves affected subpopulations with a higher precision than alternatives
  while maintaining the same recall and accuracy. Using a real dataset with randomized
  push interventions among the medical intern population at a large hospital, we show
  how our approach can be used to identify subgroups who might benefit the most from
  interventions.
