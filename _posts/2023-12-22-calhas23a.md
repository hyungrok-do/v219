abstract: Topographical structures represent connections between entities and provide
  a comprehensive design of complex systems. Currently these structures are used to
  discover correlates of neuronal and haemodynamical activity. In this work, we incorporate
  them with neural processing techniques to perform regression, using electrophysiological
  activity to retrieve haemodynamics. To this end, we use Fourier features, attention
  mechanisms, shared space between modalities and incorporation of style in the latent
  representation. By combining these techniques, we propose several models that significantly
  outperform current state-of-the-art of this task in resting state and task-based
  recording settings. Additionally, we show how the developed mapping functions are
  able to extrapolate to a diagnostic setting. We report which EEG electrodes are
  the most relevant for the regression task and which relations impacted it the most.
  Complementary, we observe that haemodynamic activity at the scalp, in contrast with
  sub-cortical regions, is relevant to the learned shared space. Overall, these results
  suggest that EEG electrode relationships are pivotal to retain information necessary
  for haemodynamical activity retrieval.
