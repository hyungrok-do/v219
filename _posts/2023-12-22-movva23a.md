abstract: 'Healthcare data in the United States often records only a patient’s coarse
  race group: for example, both Indian and Chinese patients are typically coded as
  “Asian.” It is unknown, however, whether this coarse coding conceals meaningful
  disparities in the performance of clinical risk scores across granular race groups.
  Here we show that it does. Using data from 418K emergency department visits, we
  assess clinical risk score performance disparities across 26 granular groups for
  three outcomes, five risk scores, and four performance metrics. Across outcomes
  and metrics, we show that the risk scores exhibit significant granular performance
  disparities within coarse race groups. In fact, variation in performance within
  coarse groups often exceeds the variation between coarse groups. We explore why
  these disparities arise, finding that outcome rates, feature distributions, and
  relationships between features and outcomes all vary significantly across granular
  groups. Our results suggest that healthcare providers, hospital systems, and machine
  learning researchers should strive to collect, release, and use granular race data
  in place of coarse race data, and that existing analyses may significantly underestimate
  racial disparities in performance.'
