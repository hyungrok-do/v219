abstract: 'Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare monitoring
  applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality (gold-standard)
  labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is often costly and
  time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on small-scale datasets
  often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well to unseen scenarios. At
  the same time, large amounts of imprecise (silver-standard) labeled data, annotated
  by approximate methods with the help of modern wearables and in the absence of ground
  truth validation, are starting to emerge. However, due to measurement differences,
  this data displays significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use
  of domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components:
  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multi-discriminator Adversarial Training, where
  we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial adaptation with
  the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In particular, we showcase
  the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF)
  prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of metabolic disease and mortality, and
  it presents labels with various levels of noise (gold- and silver-standard), making
  it challenging to establish an accurate prediction model. Our results show promising
  performance by alleviating distribution shifts in various label shift settings.
  Additionally, by using data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS),
  we show that UDAMA consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer
  learning and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging
  noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale.'
