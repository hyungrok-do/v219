abstract: Global access to statistically and clinically representative patient health
  data holds potential for advancing disease research, enhancing patient care, and
  accelerating drug development. However, acquisition of health data such as electronic
  health records (EHRs) comes with challenges characterised by high costs, time constraints,
  and concerns related to patient privacy. An approach to tackling these challenges
  is by using synthetic data. In this paper we introduce ScoEHR, a novel deep learning
  method for generating synthetic EHRs, which combines an autoencoder with a continuous-time
  diffusion model. ScoEHR is shown to outperform three baseline synthetic EHR generation
  frameworks (medGAN, medWGAN, and medBGAN) on two publicly available datasets, MIMIC-III
  and the Yale New Haven Health System Emergency Department dataset, based on four
  widely accepted metrics of data utility. Additionally, a blind clinician evaluation
  was carried out to assess the qualitative realism of the synthetic data generated
  by ScoEHR. In this evaluation, a patient’s data was labeled as ‘unrealistic’ if
  at least one clinician found it to be unrealistic. This evaluation showed that existing
  real EHR data and ScoEHR generated synthetic data were scored as equally realistic.
