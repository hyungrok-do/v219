abstract: 'Survival analysis is a widely-used technique for analyzing time-to-event
  data in the presence of censoring. In recent years, numerous survival analysis methods
  have emerged which scale to large datasets and relax traditional assumptions such
  as proportional hazards. These models, while being performant, are very sensitive
  to model hyperparameters including: (1) number of bins and bin size for discrete
  models and (2) number of cluster assignments for mixture-based models. Each of these
  choices requires extensive tuning by practitioners to achieve optimal performance.
  In addition, we demonstrate in empirical studies that: (1) optimal bin size may
  drastically differ based on the metric of interest (e.g., concordance vs brier score),
  and (2) mixture models may suffer from mode collapse and numerical instability.
  We propose a survival analysis approach which eliminates the need to tune hyperparameters
  such as mixture assignments and bin sizes, reducing the burden on practitioners.
  We show that the proposed approach matches or outperforms baselines on several real-world
  datasets.'
