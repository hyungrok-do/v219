abstract: In machine learning, incorporating more data is often seen as a reliable
  strategy for improving model performance; this work challenges that notion by demonstrating
  that the addition of external datasets in many cases can hurt the resulting model’s
  performance. In a large-scale empirical study across combinations of four different
  open-source chest x-ray datasets and 9 different labels, we demonstrate that in
  43% of settings, a model trained on data from two hospitals has poorer worst group
  accuracy over both hospitals than a model trained on just a single hospital’s data.
  This surprising result occurs even though the added hospital makes the training
  distribution more similar to the test distribution. We explain that this phenomenon
  arises from the spurious correlation that emerges between the disease and hospital,
  due to hospital-specific image artifacts. We highlight the trade-off one encounters
  when training on multiple datasets, between the obvious benefit of additional data
  and insidious cost of the introduced spurious correlation. In some cases, balancing
  the dataset can remove the spurious correlation and improve performance, but it
  is not always an effective strategy. We contextualize our results within the literature
  on spurious correlations to help explain these outcomes. Our experiments underscore
  the importance of exercising caution when selecting training data for machine learning
  models, especially in settings where there is a risk of spurious correlations such
  as with medical imaging. The risks outlined highlight the need for careful data
  selection and model evaluation in future research and practice.
