abstract: 'Clinical trial matching is a key process in health delivery and discovery.
  In practice, it is plagued by overwhelming unstructured data and unscalable manual
  processing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on scaling clinical trial
  matching using large language models (LLMs), with oncology as the focus area. Our
  study is grounded in a clinical trial matching system currently in test deployment
  at a large U.S. health network. Initial findings are promising: out of box, cutting-edge
  LLMs, such as GPT-4, can already structure elaborate eligibility criteria of clinical
  trials and extract complex matching logic (e.g., nested AND/OR/NOT). While still
  far from perfect, LLMs substantially outperform prior strong baselines and may serve
  as a preliminary solution to help triage patient-trial candidates with humans in
  the loop. Our study also reveals a few significant growth areas for applying LLMs
  to end-to-end clinical trial matching, such as context limitation and accuracy,
  especially in structuring patient information from longitudinal medical records.'
