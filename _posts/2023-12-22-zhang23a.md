abstract: 'Real-world time-series data is riddled with heterogeneity that is often
  present across a number of dataset dimensions: features, labels, and time-varying
  factors. The heterogeneity in time-series data may be raised by introducing new
  features, missing data, and domain shifts in the feature dimension, and the difficulty
  of collecting promising ground truth results in label uncertainty. In addition,
  the variation on the time manner further aggravates the complexity of data heterogeneity,
  since the features and labels may change on the same sequence of data over time.
  Many machine learning techniques have been proposed to address the data heterogeneity,
  including transfer learning, meta-learning, semi-supervised learning, recurrent
  networks, etc. However, each of these techniques is limited to one type of heterogeneity.
  In this study, we seek to create adaptable models for the multi-source heterogeneity
  in time-series data. We propose a semi-supervised-based meta-learning (SSML) with
  an adversarial training mechanism simultaneously addressing the heterogeneous features
  and labeling uncertainty, a time domain variation (TDV) framework to apply SSML
  and transfer learning for the third level of data heterogeneity. We test our models
  on two medical datasets, PhysioNet Challenge 2012 and MIMIC-III ICU dataset, and
  improve over all benchmark models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lidazhang/
  ssml-time-series-heterogeneity.git.'
