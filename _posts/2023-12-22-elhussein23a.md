abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework that enables multiple
  organizations to train a model without sharing their data with a central server.
  However, it experiences significant performance degradation if the data is non-identically
  independently distributed (non-IID). This is a problem in medical settings, where
  variations in the patient population contribute significantly to distribution differences
  across hospitals. Personalized FL addresses this issue by accounting for site-specific
  distribution differences. Clustered FL, a Personalized FL variant, was used to address
  this problem by clustering patients into groups across hospitals and training separate
  models on each group. However, privacy concerns remained as a challenge as the clustering
  process requires exchange of patient-level information. This was previously solved
  by forming clusters using aggregated data, which led to inaccurate groups and performance
  degradation. In this study, we propose Privacy-preserving Community-Based Federated
  machine Learning (PCBFL), a novel Clustered FL framework that can cluster patients
  using patient-level data while protecting privacy. PCBFL uses Secure Multiparty
  Computation, a cryptographic technique, to securely calculate patient-level similarity
  scores across hospitals. We then evaluate PCBFL by training a federated mortality
  prediction model using 20 sites from the eICU dataset. We compare the performance
  gain from PCBFL against traditional and existing Clustered FL frameworks. Our results
  show that PCBFL successfully forms clinically meaningful cohorts of low, medium,
  and high-risk patients. PCBFL outperforms traditional and existing Clustered FL
  frameworks with an average AUC improvement of 4.3% and AUPRC improvement of 7.8%.
