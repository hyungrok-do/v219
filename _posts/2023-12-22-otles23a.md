abstract: 'As data shift or new data become available, updating clinical machine learning
  models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time. However, updating
  a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior of the updated model
  does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor user-model team performance.
  Existing compatibility measures depend on model decision thresholds, limiting their
  applicability in settings where models are used to generate rankings based on estimated
  risk. To address this limitation, we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure,
  CR, and a new loss function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while
  encouraging good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
  leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while maintaining
  discriminative performance compared to existing model selection techniques, with
  an increase in CR of 0.019 (95% confidence interval: 0.005, 0.035). This work provides
  new tools to analyze and update risk stratification models used in clinical care.'
