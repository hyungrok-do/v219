abstract: The large amount of time clinicians spend sifting through patient notes
  and documenting in electronic health records (EHRs) is a leading cause of clinician
  burnout. By proactively and dynamically retrieving relevant notes during the documentation
  process, we can reduce the effort required to find relevant patient history. In
  this work, we conceptualize the use of EHR audit logs for machine learning as a
  source of supervision of note relevance in a specific clinical context, at a particular
  point in time. Our evaluation focuses on the dynamic retrieval in the emergency
  department, a high acuity setting with unique patterns of information retrieval
  and note writing. We show that our methods can achieve an AUC of 0.963 for predicting
  which notes will be read in an individual note writing session. We additionally
  conduct a user study with several clinicians and find that our framework can help
  clinicians retrieve relevant information more efficiently. Demonstrating that our
  framework and methods can perform well in this demanding setting is a promising
  proof of concept that they will translate to other clinical settings and data modalities
  (e.g., labs, medications, imaging).
