abstract: 'Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest who enter a coma are at high
  risk of death. Forecasting neurological outcomes of these patients (i.e., the task
  of neurological prognostication) could help with treatment decisions: which patients
  are likely to awaken from their coma and should be kept on life-sustaining therapies,
  and which are so ill that they would unlikely benefit from treatment? In this paper,
  we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first dynamic framework for neurological
  prognostication of post-cardiac-arrest comatose patients using EEG data: our framework
  makes predictions for a patient over time as more EEG data become available, and
  different training patients’ available EEG time series could vary in length. Predictions
  themselves are phrased in terms of either time-to-event outcomes (time-to-awakening
  or time-to-death) or as the patient’s probability of awakening or of dying across
  multiple time horizons (e.g., within the next 24, 48, or 72 hours). Our framework
  is based on using any dynamic survival analysis model that supports competing risks
  in the form of estimating patient-level cumulative incidence functions. We consider
  three competing risks as to what happens first to a patient: awakening, being withdrawn
  from life-sustaining therapies (and thus deterministically dying), or dying (by
  other causes). For some patients, we do not know which of these happened first since
  they were still in a coma when data collection stopped (i.e., their outcome is censored).
  Competing risks models readily accommodate such patients. We demonstrate our framework
  by benchmarking three existing dynamic survival analysis models that support competing
  risks on a real dataset of 922 post-cardiac-arrest coma patients. Our main experimental
  findings are that: (1) the classical Fine and Gray model which only uses a patient’s
  static features and summary statistics from the patient’s latest hour’s worth of
  EEG data is highly competitive, achieving accuracy scores as high as the recently
  developed Dynamic-DeepHit model that uses substantially more of the patient’s EEG
  data; and (2) in an ablation study, we show that our choice of modeling three competing
  risks results in a model that is at least as accurate while learning more information
  than simpler models (using two competing risks or a standard survival analysis setup
  with no competing risks).'
