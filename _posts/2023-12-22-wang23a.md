abstract: 'Medical conversations between patients and medical professionals have implicit
  functional sections, such as “history taking”, “summarization”, “education”, and
  “care plan.” In this work, we are interested in learning to automatically extract
  these sections. A direct approach would require collecting large amounts of expert
  annotations for this task, which is inherently costly due to the contextual inter-and-intra
  variability between these sections. This paper presents an approach that tackles
  the problem of learning to classify medical dialogue into functional sections without
  requiring a large number of annotations. Our approach combines pseudo-labeling and
  human-in-the-loop. First, we bootstrap using weak supervision with pseudo-labeling
  to generate dialogue turn-level pseudo-labels and train a transformer-based model,
  which is then applied to individual sentences to create noisy sentence-level labels.
  Second, we iteratively refine sentence-level labels using a cluster-based human-in-the-loop
  approach. Each iteration requires only a few dozen annotator decisions. We evaluate
  the results on an expert-annotated dataset of 100 dialogues and find that while
  our models start with 69.5% accuracy, we can iteratively improve it to 82.5%. Code
