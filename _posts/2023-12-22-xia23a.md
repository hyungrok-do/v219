abstract: 'We used survival analysis to quantify the impact of postdischarge evaluation
  and management (E/M) services in preventing hospital readmission or death. Our approach
  avoids a common pitfall when applying machine learning to this problem: inflated
  treatment effect estimates due to survivors bias â€“ where the magnitude of inflation
  may be conditional on heterogeneous confounders in the population. This bias arises
  simply because in order to receive an intervention after discharge, a person must
  not have been readmitted in the intervening period. After deriving an expression
  for the phantom effect due to survivors bias, we controlled for this and other biases
  within an inherently interpretable model that quilts together linear functions using
  Bayesian multilevel modeling. We identified case management services as being the
  most impactful for reducing readmissions overall.'
