abstract: 'The human brain is at the center of complex neurobiological systems, and
  understanding its structural and functional mechanisms remains an intriguing goal
  for neuroscience research. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the
  most widespread and important sources of neurological data, it poses daunting analysis
  challenges. Due to recent advances in graph theory and machine learning on graphs,
  representing the connections of the human brain as a network has become one of the
  most pervasive analytical paradigms. However, most existing graph machine learning-based
  methods suffer from a subset of four critical limitations: They are 1) designed
  for one type of data (e.g., fMRI or sMRI) and one individual subject, limiting their
  ability to use complementary information provided by different images. 2) designed
  in supervised or transductive settings, limiting their generalizability to unseen
  patterns. 3) designed for classifying brain networks, limiting their ability to
  reveal underlying patterns that might cause the symptoms of a disease or disorder.
  4) frequently unable to scale to large numbers of samples. To address the first
  limitation, we suggest using multiplex networks–networks with different types of
  connections– to model the network of different data samples. We present ADMire,
  an inductive and unsupervised anomaly detection method for multiplex brain networks
  that can detect anomalous patterns in the brains of people living with a disease
  or disorder. It uses two different casual multiplex walks, inter-view and intra-view,
  to automatically extract and learn temporal network motifs. It then uses an anonymization
  strategy to hide node identity, keeping the model inductive. We then propose a novel
  negative sample generator strategy for multiplex networks that lets our model learn
  anomalous patterns in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments on Parkinson’s Disease,
  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder show the
  efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalous brain activity
  in people living with these diseases or disorders.'
