abstract: 'Recent advances in immunomics have shown that T-cell receptor (TCR) signatures
  can accurately predict active or recent infection by leveraging the high specificity
  of TCR binding to disease antigens. However, the extreme diversity of the adaptive
  immune repertoire presents challenges in reliably identifying disease-specific TCRs.
  Population genetics and sequencing depth can also have strong systematic effects
  on repertoires, which requires careful consideration when developing diagnostic
  models. We present an Adaptive Immune Repertoire-Invariant Variational Autoencoder
  (AIRIVA), a generative model that learns a low-dimensional, interpretable, and compositional
  representation of TCR repertoires to disentangle such systematic effects in repertoires.
  We apply AIRIVA to two infectious disease case-studies: COVID-19 (natural infection
  and vaccination) and the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), and empirically
  show that we can disentangle the individual disease signals. We further demonstrate
  AIRIVAâ€™s capability to: learn from unlabelled samples; generate in-silico TCR repertoires
  by intervening on the latent factors; and identify disease-associated TCRs validated
  using TCR annotations from external assay data.'
