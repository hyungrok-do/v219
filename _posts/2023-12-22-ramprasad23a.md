abstract: The widespread adoption of SOAP notes for documenting diverse aspects of
  patient information in healthcare has been prevalent. However, the conventional
  process of manual note-taking is laborious and can distract healthcare providers
  from addressing patientsâ€™ needs. Prior work by Krishna et al. (2021a) has introduced
  an end-to-end pipeline for generating SOAP notes, but model-generated notes are
  susceptible to inaccuracies, irrelevant and missing information. In this work, we
  assess the performance of large language models (GPT-3.5) for SOAP note generation,
  compare them with fine-tuned models using automated metrics, and propose a solution
  to improve the consistency and faithfulness of notes by incorporating attribute-specific
  information via SOAP section information. To achieve this, we integrate an extra
  layer of unique section-specific cross-attention parameters to existing encoder-decoder
  architectures. Our approach is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of automated
  metrics and expert human evaluators, demonstrating that it leads to more accurate,
  relevant, and faithful information.
