abstract: With the increasing popularity of telehealth, it is crucial to ensure accurate
  monitoring of basic physiological signals at home with minimal patient overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a contactless approach for monitoring blood oxygen levels
  simply by analyzing radio signals in a patient’s room, without the need for wearable
  devices. Our method extracts a patient’s respiration from radio signals that bounce
  off their body, and we use a novel neural network, called Gated BERT-UNet, to estimate
  blood oxygen saturation from the breathing signal. We designed our model to adapt
  to a patient’s medical indices, such as gender and sleep stages, to provide personalized
  inference. Specifically, it uses multiple predictive heads, controlled by a gate,
  to make predictions for different sub-populations. Our extensive empirical results
  demonstrate that our model achieves high accuracy on both medical and radio-frequency
  datasets. It outperforms past work on contactless oxygen monitoring, reducing the
  mean absolute error in oxygen saturation from 2.0% to 1.3%.
